# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. The steps I took digging into this was starting with the first spec file and running the tests and fixing the code until I had all tests passing. Once I got a file working, I moved onto the next.

2. You basically have to read through it all to familiarize yourself with it. When you write your own code, you already have a good idea on how it works, what methods you have and what code does what.

3. It was easier to read it than I thought. I figured jumping into code I didn't write might have syntax that I'm unfamiliar with but I caught on pretty easily. Also having syntax written differently than mine gives me the ability to pick and choose how I write my own code since seeing it differently.
